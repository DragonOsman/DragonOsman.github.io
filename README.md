# DragonOsman.github.io
This is the repository for my portfolio website's source code. It's hosted on GitHub Pages. 

The CNAME I've set is a subdomain of Dynu, so I can't post it on Facebook or Facebook Messenger.  I'll just leave the URL here and link this repository when I want to give the link on Facebook or Facebook Messenger in that case.  The URL is https://www.osmanzakir.dynu.net
